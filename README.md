# How to help the project

Welcome to the Cloud Security Alliance Guidance 4.0 project on GitHub. Here are is how to participate:

* **We need your feedback!!!** Although we have a dedicated writing team, this is still a community project. The idea is to generate a cleaner and more consistent document than possible when relying on working groups to do their own writing, while still reflecting the collective wisdom of the community.
* All feedback and edits will be managed via GitHub so that all parts of the process are open and public.
* You don't need to use any special command line GitHub tools, for this project the web interface will allow you to read documents, provide feedback, and participate. But feel free to use those tools if you know how.
* Here is how to use GitHub to provide feedback:
	* *Issues* are the best way to add comments. The authors can read and respond to them directly. When leaving an issue. please list the line number for the start of any specific section you are commenting on.
	* *Pull requests are for edits*. We *can't respond to all pull requests* since the options are to ignore it or merge the changes. For consistency sake, it is very hard to take pull requests directly. All pull requests will be reviewed, some will be merged, and ones we can't directly merge will be treated as an issue/comment and closed. This is just a practical matter considering how many people will eventually be providing feedback.
* For writing we are using the Markdown text format. If you go to edit and send pull requests you will need to learn Markdown (it's incredibly simple). GitHub renders Markdown directly, so unless you are actually editing content, you won't need to learn it.
* Keep all feedback in public, on GitHub. This is essential to maintaining the independence and objectivity of the project. Even if you know any of the authors or CSA staff, please don't email private feedback, which will be ignored. 

We will do our absolute best to respond to all feedback, but depending on volume we may need to combine feedback (since we know some will even be contradictory at times). 

## The project process

Here is what you can expect:

* We will have a separate file for each domain in the Guidance.
* For each domain, we will first publish a detailed outline with expected changes, and then the drafts. Domains will be open for feedback this entire time, but may be closed during different writing phases (e.g. after we collect comments on the outline, the author may close feedback as they develop the first draft).
* The exception is Domain 1. We skipped the outline for that and went straight to the first draft so we would have something to set the writing tone for the rest of the project.
* For each domain, there will be an outline, first draft, and near-final draft.
* The near-final drafts will be pulled from GitHub and converted into Word, with updated graphics, for final publication.

If you have any questions or comments, please let us know, and thank you for your help.
